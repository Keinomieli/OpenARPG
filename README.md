Free and open ARPG game template for Godot.
  
Note that the first time you open the Godot project it will throw a message that the plugin cannot be loaded. This is expected as the code is not compiled. Click the hammer icon at the top right to compile the source code after which you can enable the plugin at the project settings.  
  
The plugin is not mandatory for the operation of the game template. It only adds editor inspector buttons for certain classes for development functions.
